==================
Retention of files
==================

Nextcloud's Files Retention app allows to automatically delete files that
are tagged with a collaborative tag and have a certain age.

Example
-------

After installing the Retention app as described in :doc:`../apps_management`
navigate to the configuration and locate the Workflow settings.

    .. figure:: images/retention_sample.png
       :alt: Sample rule to delete files after 14 days after creation.

The rule from the example will delete all files tagged with ``Temporary file`` 14 days after the creation.

You can also use the "Notify owner a day before a file is automatically deleted" option to
make sure the file owner will get a notification before a file will be deleted.

Common misconfigurations
------------------------

Public collaborative tag
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Similar to :doc:`access_control` retention should use ``restricted`` or ``invisible``
tags. Otherwise any user can remove the tag and the file is not removed after the given
period. Use :doc:`automated_tagging` to assign such tags to newly uploaded files.

File age
^^^^^^^^

Currently retention is based on the creation date of the file. The sync client sends
the **original** creation date to the server, while uploading through the web interface
will create a new file with a **new** creation date.
We hope to be able to add a ``upload date`` to the filesystem soon, which would make more
sense. Until then this potentially unexpected behavior has to be taken into account.
